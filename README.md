# Requiremetns
The code should work with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3. It depends on some external libraries which should be installed, including:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- plotnine
- warnings

The installation in [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) of the repository with all the necessary packages can be done through the **environment.yml** file. You can perform the installation by running this command in the terminal:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

or  install these libraries is to use pip

    pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn plotnine warnings

On the other hand, the database is not available for sharing.
